# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Read the elements of augmented matrix into arrays a and b
2. Calculate elements of L and U
3. Print elements of L and U
4. Find V by solving LV = B by forward substitution 
5. Find X by solving UX = V by backward substitution
6. Print Array X as the solution
## Program:

## (i) Program to find the L and U matrix.
 Developed by: s.vinod kumar
 
 RegisterNumber: 22004903
```python
from scipy.linalg import lu
a=eval(input())
P,L,U=lu(a)
print(L)
print(U)
```

## (ii)  Program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.
 Developed by: s.vinod kumar
 
 RegisterNumber: 22004903
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu_factor,lu_solve
a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
lu,piv=lu_factor(a)
x=lu_solve((lu,piv),b)
print(x)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
